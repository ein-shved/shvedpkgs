<!-- AI guidance: explain WHY this change is needed. Cover motivation, current pain,
     proposed solution, and scope. Do not write requirements here. -->

# Proposal: {{change.name}}

## Motivation

<!-- What problem are we solving? Why does it need to be solved now? -->

## Current behaviour

<!-- Describe the current state. What happens today? What is missing or broken? -->

## Proposed solution

<!-- High-level description of what we want to build or change. -->

## Specs affected

### New specs

<!-- Specs to be created. Each gets SDD artifacts under
     specs/<workspace>/<capability-path>/, starting with requirements.md,
     system.md, and verify.md. -->

- `<workspace>:<capability-path>`: <!-- brief description of what this spec covers -->
  - Depends on: <!-- list spec IDs this spec depends on, or "none" -->

### Modified specs

<!-- Existing specs whose requirements are changing. Each needs a delta file.
     Only list if spec-level behaviour changes — not just implementation. -->

- `<workspace>:<capability-path>`: <!-- what requirement is changing and why -->
  - Depends on (added): <!-- new dependencies introduced by this change, or "none" -->

## Impact

<!-- Affected code areas, APIs, data models, or external dependencies. -->

## Technical context

<!-- Capture technical insights, constraints, and decisions discussed during the
     proposal conversation that should inform specs and design. Record what was
     actually discussed — if concrete structures, file paths, or interfaces came
     up, include them. Focus on:
     - Technical constraints discovered (API limitations, performance bounds, compatibility)
     - Alternatives evaluated and why they were ruled out
     - Architectural direction agreed upon (patterns, layers, boundaries)
     - Domain modelling decisions (entity vs value object, aggregate boundaries)
     - Concrete structures or interfaces discussed, even if preliminary
     This section preserves conversational context so it is not lost between
     sessions. Do not invent design details that were not discussed — only
     record what was actually agreed or explored with the user. -->

## Open questions

<!-- Any unresolved questions or decisions that need to be made before spec work begins. -->
