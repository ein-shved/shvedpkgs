# specd-archive — finalize and archive

Read @../\_specd-shared/shared.md before doing anything.

## What this does

Reviews deltas and archives the change. Archiving merges deltas into project specs
and is irreversible. The change MUST already be in `archivable` state — the signoff
gate is handled by `$specd-verify`, not by this skill.

## Steps

### 1. Load change state

```bash
specd changes status <name> --format text
```

Identify any high-visibility blockers from the **blockers:** section (e.g. `ARTIFACT_DRIFT`,
`OVERLAP_CONFLICT`, `REVIEW_REQUIRED`) and inform the user. Follow the **next action:**
command recommendation.

Extract the `path:` field from the "lifecycle:" section.

If the status output shows `review: required: yes`, tell the user:

> Artifacts need review before archiving. Run `$specd-design <name>` to update them.

**Stop — do not continue.**

If state is not `archivable`, this is the wrong skill.
Redirect based on the **next action:** `target` recommendation.

**Stop — do not continue.**

### 2. Load context

```bash
specd changes context <name> archiving --follow-deps --depth 1 --format text [--fingerprint <stored-value>]
```

Pass `--fingerprint <stored-value>` if you have a `contextFingerprint` from a previous `changes context` call in this conversation (see `shared.md` — "Fingerprint mechanism"). If output says `unchanged`, use the context already in memory.

**MUST follow** — project context entries are binding directives. If lazy mode returns
summary specs, evaluate and load any that are relevant (see `shared.md` — "Processing
`changes context` output").

### 3. Ask before archiving

> **Ready to archive `<name>`.** This will merge all deltas into your project specs
> and move the change to the archive. This cannot be undone.
>
> Say **"archive"** to proceed, or request changes first.

**Do NOT proceed until the user explicitly says "archive" or equivalent.**

### 4. Pre-archive hooks

```bash
specd changes run-hooks <name> archiving --phase pre
specd changes hook-instruction <name> archiving --phase pre --format text
```

Follow guidance — review deltas to ensure specs match what was built.

When reviewing spec-scoped deltas, inspect merged output with
`specd changes spec-preview <name> <specId> --format text` if overlap, drift, or
stale-base risk exists, or if you have only read raw delta files. Raw deltas are not
enough to confirm the archived spec will preserve important existing content.
If only one merged spec-scoped artifact is needed for review, use
`specd changes spec-preview <name> <specId> --artifact <artifactId> --format text`.

### 5. Archive

```bash
specd changes archive <name> --skip-hooks all --format toon
```

If the command fails with a `SpecOverlapError` (spec overlap detected), other active
changes target the same specs as this change. When this happens:

1. Show the user the overlapping specs and the other changes involved.
2. Explain the risk.
3. Ask the user whether to proceed or abort.

If the user confirms, re-run the command with `--allow-overlap`:

```bash
specd changes archive <name> --skip-hooks all --allow-overlap --format toon
```

### 6. Post-archive hooks

```bash
specd changes run-hooks <name> archiving --phase post
specd changes hook-instruction <name> archiving --phase post --format text
```

Follow guidance.

### 7. Regenerate metadata

```bash
specd specs generate-metadata --all --write --status stale,missing
```

### 8. Check LLM optimization

```bash
specd project status --format toon
```

Reuse a fresh `project status` result from this archive execution if it already
contains `approvals.llmOptimized`; otherwise run the command.

If `approvals.llmOptimized` is `true`, suggest running `$specd-spec-metadata` for each
spec in the change.

### 9. Done

> Change `<name>` archived. Deltas merged into specs.

**Stop.**
Do not invoke any follow-up skill automatically; wait for explicit user confirmation.

## Session tasks

1. `Load state & context`
2. `Pre-archive review`
3. `Archive change`
4. `Post-archive & metadata`

## Handling failed transitions

When `changes transition` fails, it renders a **Repair Guide** in text mode.
Follow the recommended repair command based on the target recommendation.

## Returning to design

If during the pre-archive review you discover that the artifacts need revision, stop and explain.
If the user agrees:

```bash
specd changes transition <name> designing --skip-hooks all
```

> Specs need revision before archiving. Run `$specd-design <name>` to update them.

**Stop — do not archive.**

## Guardrails

- **Always ask before archiving** — it's irreversible
- Review deltas before confirming — specs should match what was built
- Any time a fresh `changes status` shows `review: required: yes`, stop
  archiving and redirect to `$specd-design <name>`
